The following report returns the number of Active Directory users that currently exist on the Identity tenant.
SELECT Count (User.SourceDs) AS DirectorySource FROM User WHERE User.SourceDs = "AdProxy_cnaroot.com"
 
The following report will return a list of Active Directory users that haven’t authenticated to the Tenant in over a year.
Note: You can get the number (58) of users from the following SQL query.
SELECT COUNT(User.Username) AS InactiveUserCount
FROM User
WHERE User.LastLogin <= DateFunc('now', '-365') AND User.SourceDs = "AdProxy_cnaroot.com"
 
Recommendation: Remove all Users (Active Directory & Federated) that haven’t authenticated to the Tenant in the last year.
Note: CyberArk Flows could be leveraged alongside the SQL statement below to remove these users from the Tenant.
 
SELECT User.Email, User.ID, User.LastLogin, User.LoginName, User.Status, User.Username,      User.SourceDs
FROM User
WHERE User.LastLogin <= DateFunc('now','-365') AND User.SourceDs = "AdProxy_cnaroot.com"
ORDER BY User.LastLogin
